## Saltyminer

This repository is now read only as of 4/14/2022.

Welcome to Saltyminer! I created this basic UI interface as a simple project in order to try to learn more about the WPF Framework and try to help out the community in the process. Although this project is no longer being maintained, feel free to experiment with any of my code.

#
If you would like to compile a functional version of Saltyminer, use the files in the legacy branch. However, you can mess around with the nonfunctional version in the master branch. Feel free to open any new branches or pull requests.

#
Because Raptoreum is no longer profitable to mine, this project is officially discontinued. However, I want to give my thanks to all who have supported this project.
